## NoteBook 01 - Baseline

	A baseline metric was calculated
	
## NoteBook 02 - TargetAnalysis

	The target was analyzed by being a stationary series or not and if not, check how to make it stationary
	
## NoteBook 03 - FirstModels

	With features of the oil data some models were studied by the same error metric of the baseline
	>> Conclusion: All models are worse

	Economic data collected from Quandl
	
	
## NoteBook 05 - Features
	
	Model Select: LGBMRegressor
	implementation of features and their evaluation
