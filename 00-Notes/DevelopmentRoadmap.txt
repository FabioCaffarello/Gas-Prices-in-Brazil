## NoteBook 01 - Baseline

	A baseline metric was calculated
	
## NoteBook 02 - TargetAnalysis

	The target was analyzed by being a stationary series or not and if not, check how to make it stationary
	
## NoteBook 03 - ModelsSelection

	With simple features some models were studied by the same error metric of the baseline
	
## NoteBook 04 - ModelsSelectionOneHotEncoding

	One hot encoding method was implemented for the product
	>> Conclusion: All models are worse
	
Next Steps:

- Selecionar um modelo para escolher as features a fim de melhorar a modelagem
	-Features from internal and external data

- Tuning the Hyperparameters

- Determine a more robust Validation
